# Infrastructure Deployment Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This infrastructure plan was generated by Inframate based on analyzing your application's requirements and codebase structure.

### Recommended AWS Services:

AWS S3, AWS CloudFront, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL), AWS VPC, AWS IAM, AWS CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Certificate Manager, AWS Route 53, AWS Auto Scaling, AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB)

## Detailed Recommendations

*   **Static Asset Hosting:** Store the React application's static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) in an AWS S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.  Utilize AWS CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache and distribute these assets globally, improving performance and reducing latency for users. Enable S3 bucket versioning for disaster recovery.
*   **API/Backend Logic:** Implement the backend logic (if any) using AWS Lambda functions. Use AWS API Gateway to expose these Lambda functions as REST APIs.  This serverless architecture offers scalability and cost-efficiency.
*   **Database (Inferred):** Since the database type is unknown, let's assume a relational database is needed. Choose Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL or MySQL based on preference and specific requirements. Configure RDS for Multi-AZ deployment for high availability. Consider Aurora for more scalability.
*   **Networking:** Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate the application's resources. Implement public and private subnets. Place the ALB in the public subnets and the RDS instance and Lambda functions in the private subnets. Use Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets, if needed.
*   **Load Balancing & Auto Scaling:** Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic to the Lambda functions (via API Gateway) and potentially to other backend services if the application grows beyond the Lambda-based architecture.  If direct EC2 hosting is required (unlikely, but a contingency), ALB can also route traffic to EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group.
*   **Security:** Use AWS IAM roles to grant permissions to AWS resources. Follow the principle of least privilege. Encrypt data at rest and in transit using AWS KMS and TLS certificates (managed by AWS Certificate Manager).  Implement security groups to control network traffic.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor application and infrastructure metrics. Collect and analyze logs using CloudWatch Logs. Enable AWS CloudTrail to audit API calls and user activity.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Consider using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy for a fully managed CI/CD pipeline. Alternatively, integrate with existing CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
*   **DNS:** Use AWS Route 53 for DNS management and to point the domain to the CloudFront distribution.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage the infrastructure using Terraform. This ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control.
*   **Database Backup and Recovery:** Implement automated backups of the RDS database and store them securely. Test the recovery process regularly.
*   **State Management**: Properly manage the Terraform state using S3 bucket with versioning and DynamoDB table for locking.
*   **Use modules**: Use terraform modules to make the code more reusable and maintainable.

## Estimated Monthly Costs

(This is a very rough estimate and can vary widely depending on usage, region, instance types, data transfer, and other factors. Using us-east-1 as the region.)
*   **S3 (Static Assets):** $1 - $5 per month (based on storage and data transfer)
*   **CloudFront:** $5 - $20 per month (based on data transfer and requests)
*   **Lambda:** $5 - $15 per month (based on invocations and execution time)
*   **API Gateway:** $1 - $5 per month (based on API calls)
*   **RDS (db.t3.medium Multi-AZ):** $70 - $150 per month
*   **VPC:** Minimal cost (NAT Gateway can add significant cost if there's a lot of outbound traffic)
*   **IAM:** Free
*   **CloudWatch:** $5 - $20 per month (based on logs ingested and metrics)
*   **CloudTrail:** Free (for the basic level)
*   **Certificate Manager:** Free (for ACM-issued certificates)
*   **Route 53:** $0.50 per hosted zone per month + query costs
*   **ALB:** $20-50 (based on traffic and rules)
*   **Terraform State Management (S3+DynamoDB):** Less than $1
**Total Estimated Monthly Cost:** $133.50 - $316

*Note: These cost estimates are approximate and may vary based on usage patterns, region, and AWS pricing changes.*

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
   - Terraform installed (v1.0.0+)

2. **Configuration**:
   - Update variables in `terraform.tfvars` to match your requirements
   - Review the Terraform files to ensure they meet your needs

3. **Deployment**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Notes

- The Terraform files have been generated in the `terraform/` directory
- The configuration is based on the application requirements specified in `inframate.md`
- You may need to customize the Terraform files for your specific needs
